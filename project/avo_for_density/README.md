## AVO For Density

Often, density is said to be unobtainable by AVO inversion. However, a Bayesian-style AVO inversion based on a prior model, seismic data and a best estimate of their respective uncertainties is robust. It will invert for density, too, and its posterior uncertainty will be smaller. Also, from a philosophical point of view, we make optimal use of all available information.

Note, this notebook is a classic one: when using Jupyter notebook 7, switch to nbclassic.
