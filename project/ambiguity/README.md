## Subsurface-Traveltime Ambiguity

Modifying the subsurface, and the velocity of a seismic wave travelling through the subsurface, in some specific way changes the traveltime of that wave very little. Here, a Python software simulates the propagation of two waves, the original and a modified one, and displays their wavefronts. 
- A [paper](https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz/tree/master/project/ambiguity/Bj√∂rnRommel.WeaklyAnellipticalTraveltimeAnalysis.pdf) "Weakly-Anelliptical Traveltime Analysis: Ambiguity between Subsurface and Elasticity" is under review with Geophysics. 
- The corresponding [software](https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz/blob/master/project/ambiguity/ambiguity-as_used_for_manuscript.py) written in Python is also available.
