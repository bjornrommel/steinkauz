ttwean: Velocity-versus-Structure for Reflection Seismics!

ttwean is a collection of function used to investigate "stretch", a method to
generate a series of velocity-structure models all of which (approximately) 
satisfy the same traveltime curve. The subset ttwean_for_ttcpry is designed 
specifically for use with ttcpry, a software for ray-tracing simulation 
https://ttcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ of wavefield propagation by Berard 
Giroux https://inrs.ca/en/research/professors/bernard-giroux/. The software 
repository is https://github.com/groupeLIAMG/ttcr.

The file ttwean_for_ttcpry.py contains the function ttinit and ttvel wrapped 
into a class TTWean. However, you can safely rip out the functions ttinit and 
ttvel from underneath the class TTWean and use them independently outside any 
package.

Note, due to some misunderstanding of ttcrpy on my side, there is a conflict 
of notation: the parameter r in ttcpry, see the example 5, 
https://github.com/groupeLIAMG/ttcr/blob/master/examples/example5.ipynb, ought
to be the linear energy-velocity parameter s of my paper; the latter is 
computed here and must be used in place of the parameter r in ttcpry!

My software repository is https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz under the 
project Subsurface-Velocity Ambiguity.
