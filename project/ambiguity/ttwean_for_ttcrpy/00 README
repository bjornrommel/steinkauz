ttwean: Velocity-versus-Structure for Reflection Seismics!

ttwean is a collection of function used to investigate "stretch", a method to
generate a series of velocity-structure models all of which (approximately) 
satisfy the same traveltime curve. The subset ttwean_for_ttcpry is designed 
specifically for use with ttcpry, a software for ray-tracing simulation 
https://ttcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ of wavefield propagation by Berard 
Giroux https://inrs.ca/en/research/professors/bernard-giroux/. The software 
repository is https://github.com/groupeLIAMG/ttcr.

The file ttwean_for_ttcpry.py contains the function ttinit and ttvel wrapped 
into a class TTWean. However, you can safely rip out the functions ttinit and 
ttvel from underneath the class TTWean and use them independently outside any 
package.

My software repository is https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz under the 
project Subsurface-Velocity Ambiguity.
