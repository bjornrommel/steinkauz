Example 1: Mean of a Large Dataset

Select sample numbers for dataset and record. A dataset might consist of hours
or days of recording at a sampling rate of 1, 2 or 4ms, whereas a record
typically lasts 8 to 12s. To give some examples:

\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r}
    description &
    duration &
    sampling rate &
    number of samples \\
    \hhline{=|=|=|=}
    record &
    8s &
    4ms &
    2000 \\
    dataset &
    1h &
    4ms&
    900000 \\
    dataset &
    1d &
    4ms &
    21600000 \\
    dataset &
    180d &
    4ms &
    3888000000
\end{tabular}
