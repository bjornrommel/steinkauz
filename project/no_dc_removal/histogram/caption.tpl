Histogram of record means: The record means (from Fig.~\ref{fig record mean})
are binned. With increasing number of records, and a larger dataset from which
the records are derived, the resultant histogram approaches a normal
distribution with a mean $\mu_\text{record}$ of 0.0 due to calibration and a 
standard deviation $\sigma_\text{record}$ of RECORDSTDRECORD. Recall, about 
99.7\% of all samples are within $\pm$ 3 standard deviations of the mean.
