Noise dataset with mean: The noise samples, which are marked by blue dots, are
normally distributed around a mean $\mu_\text{theory}$ of 0.0 with a standard 
deviation $\sigma_\text{theory}$ of 1.0. The red line marks the actual mean
$\mu_\text{dataset}$ of \mbox{DATAMEAN}. The dataset will be calibrated 
accordingly.
