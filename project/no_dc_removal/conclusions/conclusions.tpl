\section{Conclusion}

The mean of a large dataset approaches the ideal null-line within an error 
margin of $\sigma / \sqrt{n_{\text{dataset}}}$. Not knowing the null-line any 
better, we calibrate seismic instruments accordingly. However, assuming that any
data subsets show the same mean is a logical fallacy: a calibrated dataset does 
not imply likewise calibrated records. Instead, the means of such subsets 
fluctuate around the ideal null-line with a standard deviation of 
$\sigma / \sqrt{n_{\text{record}}}$.
