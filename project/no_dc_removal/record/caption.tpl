Record means: Each record is a consecutive subset of the noise dataset
(Fig.~\ref{fig data mean}) after calibration. Here, only the means of each such
record are shown. These means $\mu_\text{record}$ fluctuate with a standard 
deviation $\sigma_\text{record}$ of RECORDSTDRECORD, in theory 
$\sigma / \sqrt{n_\text{record}} = RECORDSTDTHEORY$.
