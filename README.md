## Notebooks

- No DC Removal in Seismic Records: 
Seismic instruments are calibrated by equating their null-line with the mean of a very large noise dataset. Nonetheless, individual seismic records, which are small in size, will show means fluctuating around the null-line.

The IPython extension steinkauz provides a line / cell magic rendering all LaTeX  input both on screen as well as in print.

## Module steinkauz  

steinkauz.py is an iPython line/cell magics extension. It converts a LaTeX fragment, which it gets from a file or reads in from the notebook itself, into a PNG image. This PNG file will then be displayed inside the notebook. Key point being, that fragment can be updated in line with the results of computations made in that notebook. For details see the tutorial, and download the source file, all in their respectively named directories.

## Collaboration and Support
 
You are invited to improve any notebook or even to donate one of your own making.
