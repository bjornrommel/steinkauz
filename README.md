# Steinkauz

Projekt Steinkauz: a series of notebooks, software and tutorials on various topics of seismic data processing.

## Subsurface-Velocity Ambiguity / Python

- [Subsurface-Velocity Ambiguity](https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz/tree/master/project/ambiguity):
There exists a range of subsurface-velocity models all of which show (approximately) the same seismic response.

## Notebooks / Jupyter

- [AVO for Density](https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz/tree/master/project/avo_for_density):
Often, density is said to be unobtainable by AVO inversion. However, a Bayesian-style AVO inversion based on a prior model, seismic data and a best estimate of their respective uncertainties is robust. It will invert for density, too, and its posterior uncertainty will be smaller. Also, from a philosophical point of view, we make optimal use of all available information.

- [Steinkauz](https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz/tree/master/project/steinkauz):
The Jupyter module steinkauz provides a line / cell magic rendering all LaTeX input.

## Patent / Law

- [Time Drift Calibration:](https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz/tree/master/project/time_drift_calibration)
Calibrate a time drift of a node during its deployment (in-situ). 

## Steinkauz / Jupyter module rendering LaTeX

- [Steinkauz:](https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz/tree/master/project/steinkauz)
steinkauz.py is an iPython line/cell magics extension. It converts a LaTeX fragment, which it gets from a file or reads in from the notebook itself, into a PNG image. This PNG file will then be displayed inside the notebook. Key point being, that fragment can be updated in line with the results of computations made in that notebook. For details see the tutorial and download the source file.

## Blended Acquisition / Technical Marketing
- [Multiple Sources:](https://github.com/bjornrommel/steinkauz/tree/master/project/blended_acquisition)
An illustrative, but very technical introduction into the subject of blended acquisition including triple and penta sources.

## Collaboration and Support
 
You are invited to improve any notebook or even to donate one of your own making.

The Jupyter magic steinkauz has been inspired by Dan MacKinlay's latex_fragment (https://github.com/danmackinlay/latex_fragment)  
And, then, there are all the contributors to Jupyter Notebook!
